<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/">Lambda</a> (Cloud Functions), <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/">S3</a> (File Storage), <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/console/">Amplify Console</a> (Hosting with CI/CD and HTTPS), <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/appsync/">AppSync</a> (Realtime GraphQL), and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/">Cognito</a> (Auth) are probably the most relevant things to front-end developers.

There are frameworks that help you deploy to Lambda, like <a href="https://aws-amplify.github.io/">Amplify</a>, <a href="https://claudiajs.com/">Claudia</a>, <a href="https://ffleet.io/">Functional Fleet</a>, <a href="https://serverless.com/">Serverless</a>, and <a href="https://arc.codes/">Architect</a>.
