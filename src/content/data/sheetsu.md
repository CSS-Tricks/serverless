Sheetsu helps you connect Google Sheets to anything - Web, Mobile, IoT or any service's API.

Google Sheets has an <a href="https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/">API directly</a>, but it's not particularly easy to use. Sheetsu makes it less sheety. Get it. That's not their tagline I just wrote that. 

Also look at <a href="https://github.com/jsoma/tabletop">Tabletop.js</a> for an open source library to help with the Google Docs API.
